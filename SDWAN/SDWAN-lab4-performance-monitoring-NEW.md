# Lab 4 â€“ Performance Monitoring (NEW, Enhanced)

## ðŸ“˜ Introduction
Performance monitoring provides visibility into how the fabric is performing in real time. In this lab, youâ€™ll collect CPU, memory, and tunnel statistics from devices using Ansible. This helps identify performance bottlenecks early.

---

## Step 1 â€“ Variables
Use the same `vars.yml` from Lab 1.

---

## Step 2 â€“ Playbook
This playbook runs performance monitoring tasks.

```yaml
---
- name: SDWAN Lab4 â€” Performance Monitoring
  hosts: localhost
  gather_facts: no
  collections:
    - cisco.catalystwan

  vars_files:
    - vars.yml

  tasks:
    - name: Collect performance metrics
      cisco.catalystwan.performance_monitor:
        manager_authentication:
          url: "{{ vmanage_url }}"
          username: "{{ vmanage_username }}"
          password: "{{ vmanage_password }}"
          verify: false
      register: perf

    - name: Show performance metrics
      debug:
        var: perf
```

ðŸ”Ž **Explanation:**  
- `performance_monitor` queries device stats.  
- Metrics may include CPU, memory, interface errors, and tunnel quality.

---

## Step 3 â€“ Run the Lab
```bash
ansible-playbook SDWAN-lab4-performance-monitoring.yml
```

---

## ðŸ“Š Expected Output
- CPU and memory usage numbers.  
- Tunnel loss/latency/jitter metrics.  

---

## ðŸŽ“ Summary
You collected and displayed performance data from the SD-WAN fabric. With Ansible, this can be automated for proactive monitoring and early detection of performance issues.
