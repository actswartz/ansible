# Lab 4 â€“ Performance Monitoring (NEW, Enhanced)

## ðŸ“˜ Introduction
Performance monitoring provides visibility into how the fabric is performing in real time. In this lab, youâ€™ll collect CPU, memory, and tunnel statistics from devices using Ansible. This helps identify performance bottlenecks early.

## ðŸ“‚ Inventory Setup
## ðŸ”Ž Understanding the Inventory File

The file `SDWAN-inventory.txt` is an **Ansible inventory**. Inventories tell Ansible *which hosts to run tasks on*.

In our labs, the inventory contains:
```
[local]
localhost ansible_connection=local
```

- `[local]` is a group name â€” here we only have one group called "local".  
- `localhost` means the playbook will run on your local control machine, not on a remote server.  
- `ansible_connection=local` tells Ansible to run modules directly on the local machine instead of trying SSH.

ðŸ‘‰ Even though the playbooks target `localhost`, the actual API calls go from your Ansible control machine to **vManage** over HTTPS using the modules in the `cisco.catalystwan` collection.


In this lab, instead of only using `vars.yml`, you will also rely on an **Ansible inventory file** named `SDWAN-inventory.txt`.
This file is provided to you and already contains the host definition for `localhost` (your control machine).

Example (`SDWAN-inventory.txt`):
```
[local]
localhost ansible_connection=local
```
You will still use `vars.yml` for your vManage URL, username, and password, but the playbooks will now be run with the inventory file specified.

## Step 1 â€“ Variables
Use the same `vars.yml` from Lab 1.

---

## Step 2 â€“ Playbook
This playbook runs performance monitoring tasks.

```yaml
---
- name: SDWAN Lab4 â€” Performance Monitoring
  hosts: localhost
  gather_facts: no
  collections:
    - cisco.catalystwan

  vars_files:
    - vars.yml

  tasks:
    - name: Collect performance metrics
      cisco.catalystwan.performance_monitor:
        manager_authentication:
          url: "{{ vmanage_url }}"
          username: "{{ vmanage_username }}"
          password: "{{ vmanage_password }}"
          verify: false
      register: perf

    - name: Show performance metrics
      debug:
        var: perf
```

ðŸ”Ž **Explanation:**  
- `performance_monitor` queries device stats.  
- Metrics may include CPU, memory, interface errors, and tunnel quality.

---

## Step 3 â€“ Run the Lab
```bash
ansible-playbook -i SDWAN-inventory.txt SDWAN-lab4-performance-monitoring.yml
```

---

## ðŸ“Š Expected Output
- CPU and memory usage numbers.  
- Tunnel loss/latency/jitter metrics.  

---

## ðŸŽ“ Summary
You collected and displayed performance data from the SD-WAN fabric. With Ansible, this can be automated for proactive monitoring and early detection of performance issues.
